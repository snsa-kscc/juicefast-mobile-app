## 🎨 Architecture & Design

### Route Groups Pattern

The app uses Expo Router's modern route groups pattern for better organization:

- `(tabs)/` - Contains all tab-based navigation screens
- Root level screens are accessible via stack navigation
- Clean separation between tabbed and non-tabbed screens

### Animation System

Sophisticated animations powered by React Native Reanimated:

- **Entrance Animations**: Staggered fade-ins, slides, and zoom effects
- **Continuous Animations**: Spinning and pulsing effects
- **Spring Physics**: Natural motion with spring animations
- **Interactive Feedback**: Visual responses to user interactions

### Styling System

- **NativeWind**: Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling
- **Custom Color Palette**: Category-specific color schemes
- **Responsive Design**: Flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- **Typography**: SpaceMono font with various weights

## 🔒 Security & Performance

The app has been hardened with multiple security and performance improvements:

### Security Fixes Applied

- ✅ **Log Injection Prevention** (CWE-117)
- ✅ **HTTPS Enforcement** (CWE-319)
- ✅ **Authorization Middleware** (CWE-862)
- ✅ **XSS Protection** (CWE-79)
- ✅ **NoSQL Injection Prevention** (CWE-943)

### Performance Optimizations

- ✅ **UUID-based ID Generation** (prevents collisions)
- ✅ **Memory Leak Prevention** (proper cleanup)
- ✅ **Object Recreation Optimization** (useMemo, static objects)
- ✅ **Data Validation** (schema-based validation)
